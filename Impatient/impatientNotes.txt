+ Value declared with val is constant. var is for variable.

+ Semicolons are required only if you have multiple statements on the same line. 

+ Everything is an object in scala. Even numbers like 1,2,3.14.

+ There is no ++ or -- in scala. Instead use +=1 or -=1.

+ The usual mathematical operators can be used with BigInt and BigDecimal objects since the operators themselves represent function calls anyway. So you can directly do x * x instead of x.multiply(x)

+ Math functions such as pow(), min() in scala.math

 Can be used as sqrt(2),pow(2,4) etc.

The prefix scala. can be omitted.

import scala.math._ == import math._

+ Scala has singleton objects instead of static methods.  

+ Look into RichInt,RichDouble and StringOps in Scala docs.

+ Method tagged as implicit is an automatic conversion. Example the BigInt object has automatic conversions from int and long to BigInt.

e.g 

scala> var x=4
x: Int = 4

scala> var y:BigInt = 5
y: scala.math.BigInt = 5

scala> x+y
res15: scala.math.BigInt = 9
